Exercise 2: ODEs: The Driven Pendulum
Function definitions can be found in the file 'ex2_funcs.py'. 

Core Task 1
For an initial amplitude equal to pi/2, the period is 7.44 seconds. 
To generate plot of period vs amplitude and energy conservation, run: 
python core_task1.py

Core Task 2
Damping causes the oscillations to cessate, and a higher damping coefficient
causes this to happen quicker. A moderate value of the driving amplitude causes
the system to settle in the driving frequency, while increasing it to large
enough values causes the pendulum to go round and round. 
To generate plots of solution for various cases of damping and driving, run: 
python core_task2.py

Supplementary Task 1 
A very slight difference in initial conditions causes the solution to behave
similarly until around 100 seconds have passed, after which the solutions
diverge greatly for each of the two initial amplitudes. 
To generate plots of the solutions, run: 
python supp_task1.py

Supplementary Task 2
To generate plots of theta vs omega for a few different cases, run: 
python supp_task2.py
