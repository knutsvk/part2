Exercise 3A: Diffraction by the FFT
Function definitions can be found in the file 'ex3a_funcs.py'. 

Core Task 1
To generate plots of theoretical and computational diffraction patterns for the
single slit in the far field, run: 
python core_task1.py

Core Task 2
To generate plots of the diffraction pattern for the sinusoidal grating, run: 
python core_task2.py

Supplementary Task 1 
To generate plots of the previous two scenarios in the near-field, run: 
python supp_task1.py
